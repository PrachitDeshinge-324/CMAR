# API Keys and Model Configuration
# IMPORTANT: Replace "YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY" with your actual Google AI Studio API key.
# You can also set this as an environment variable named GOOGLE_API_KEY.
gemini:
  api_key: "Your API KEY"
  generation_model: "gemini-2.5-flash-lite"
  # Rate limiting configuration (Gemini Flash allows 15 RPM on free tier, 1000 RPD)
  # Optimized: Use 14 for maximum speed while staying within limits
  rate_limit:
    max_calls: 14
    time_window: 60  # seconds
  
  # API call optimization settings
  optimization:
    enable_critic_loop: true  # Set to false to save API calls (reduces accuracy but saves ~3 calls/patient)
    max_refinement_loops: 3    # Maximum refinement iterations (default 3, reduce to save calls)
    batch_risk_assessment: true  # Batch all risk assessments into 1 call (saves ~9 calls/patient)

embeddings:
  provider: "google"
  # models/text-embedding-004 is a powerful and efficient choice.
  model: "models/text-embedding-004"
  # The API key can be the same one used for generation.
  # The code will prioritize the GOOGLE_API_KEY environment variable if it's set.
  api_key: "Can be same as above"
